# CBMicroBit

CBMicroBit is a C++ wrapper around CoreBluetooth to easily connect a BBC Micro:Bit to a computer running OSX over Bluetooth Low Energy and output to localhost over OSC.

On starting, the program will search the Micro:bit, connect and then subscribe to the Accelerometer and Button services. 

## To Run

Simply open and run the XCode project (MicroBit.xcodeproj). 

Alternatively, run the unix execitable CBMicroBit (./CBMicroBit) from the terminal. 

## OSC Output

The program outputs to localhost:9109 by default. The output port can be set using the first argument of the program

Either edit the scheme in XCode
```
  CBMicrobit -> Edit Scheme -> Arguments -> Arguments Passed on Launch
```

Or in the terminal 
```
  ./CBMicroBit <port>
```
The ouputs are currently 
```
  /acc,<x>,<y>,<z> for the accelerometer
  /buttonA,<state> for button A state
  /buttonB,<state> for button B state
```

 The Button states are only outputted when they change 
 
  0 = off
 
  1 = press
 
  2 = longpress
  

## The Micro:Bit
We've included a hex file (CBMicrobit.hex) that can just be dragged onto the MicroBit. All it does it advertise the accelerometer, button, thermometer, LED and IO Pin services. 

Important changes to remember to make to the MicrobitConfig.h file if you are building your own project with C++ is setting MICROBIT_BLE_OPEN to 1 (this disables pairing) and MICROBIT_SD_GATT_TABLE_SIZE to its maximum, which is  0x700. If this is not done then the services will not appear.  

## Trouble shooting

### My Micro:bit isn't connecting
  Is it connected to another computer or already connected to your computer? The Micro:Bit will only connect to one Central and the program requires it to not be connected to anything when it runs (even your own computer ). You can check whether you are already connected to the Micro:Bit by clicking on the Bluetooth icon in your toolbar. If you are already connected, disconnect. The program should then pick it up again without needing to restart. 

## Editting the Project

The program is set up to run as a C++ object to be included in C++ projects, however, the internal Objective C code could easily to put into a native macOSX app (see BLEBridge.mm). 

In order to get receive the delegate callbacks for CoreBluetooth in a commandline tool (as opposed to an app), its necessary to create an NSRunLoop. This is blocks the main thread so this may have unforseen conseqeunces when included in other C++ projects. I haven't been able to get this to work without doing this or by initiating the BLEcpp object not on the main thread. You can however, execute C++ code on a background thread simultaneously whilst the Micro:Bit is connecting and and receiving dta over BLE on the main thread. There is a simple example of this in main.cpp.

To include the CBMicroBit in a C++ project simply instanitiate the BLEcpp object

```
BLEcpp ble;
```

Starting a NSRunLoop is not necessary for native macOSX apps and so this can be disabled by commenting out

```
#define CPP
```

in BLEBridge.mm

You can also change what data is reported by altering the options at the top of BLEBridge.mm

```
#define ACCELEROMETER <YES/NO>
#define BUTTON <YES/NO>
#define IO <YES/NO>
```

The IO Pin service is not yet implemented

## Contributions

We use the excellent [OscpPk](http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/oscpkt/) library to output OSC
